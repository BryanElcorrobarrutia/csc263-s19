# csc263-s19

To access the code for the class, you can either:
* clone and pull this repository
  * First time (do this only the first time).  
    * bring up a unix terminal (mac terminal, git bash... choice depends on your machine)
    * Go to the directory where you would like your code examples for this class to go (if you want it at top level, skip this step)
    * type: git clone hhttps://github.com/csc263-summer2019/csc263-s19
      This will create a directory called csc263-s19 in your current directory.  Go into that for code updates
  * All other times (to update after class):
    * go into the csc263-s19 directory
    * type: git pull origin

* view and/or download them from github: https://github.com/csc263-summer2019/csc263-s19
